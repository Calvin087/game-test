## Game Objective

SCP-096's containment door has been opened and it's stuck open. This is bad news for the rest of the SCP foundation employees.

Although calm and easy to move, SCP-096 becomes and unstoppable killing machine if you see it's face.

Your fellow agent is missing and they're the only one that knows the emergency lockdown password for this containment section.

## Clues

You have a matter of minutes to close SCP-096's door before it begins to move around the facility and puts the rest of us in danger.

By speaking to other staff memebers you may be able to figure out where the Agent has left the password OR you may be able to guess it from their notesbooks or computer.

We believe the password is a 6 digit number, but that's all we know for know.
